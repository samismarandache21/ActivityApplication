🗂️ Activity Management Application – C++
🔹 A robust C++ application designed for efficient management of various activities.
🔹 Built following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out
✅ Command-Line Interface (CLI): Operates entirely through a user-friendly CLI, eliminating the need for a graphical interface.
✅ Advanced Sorting and Filtering: Implements multiple sorting algorithms and filtering options to organize activities based on different criteria.
✅ Comprehensive Error Handling: Ensures application stability through meticulous error detection and management.
✅ Unit Testing: Incorporates a suite of unit tests to validate functionality and maintain code reliability.
✅ Design Patterns: Utilizes design patterns such as Singleton and Observer to enhance code scalability and maintainability.

🛠️ Technologies and Methodologies Used
Technology/Methodology	Purpose
🖥️ C++	Core programming language
🏗️ OOP Principles	Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
🧪 Unit Testing	Ensures code reliability and correctness
🔄 Design Patterns	Implements Singleton, Observer for scalability
🗂️ File Handling	Data storage in activities.txt
⚡ STL (Vectors)	Efficient data management
🎯 Project Features
🔹 1. Object-Oriented Architecture (OOP)
Encapsulation: Data members are private, accessed through getters/setters.
Inheritance: Structured hierarchy among classes to promote code reuse.
Polymorphism: Function overloading and overriding for flexible operations.
🔹 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Interactive CLI: Provides a straightforward interface for managing activities without the complexity of a GUI.
Menu-Driven Navigation: Users can navigate through various options seamlessly.
🔹 3. Advanced Sorting and Filtering
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Allows sorting activities by different criteria such as date, priority, or category.
Filtering Options: Users can filter activities based on specific parameters to view subsets of data.
🔹 4. Comprehensive Error Handling
Robust Error Detection: Identifies and manages errors gracefully to prevent application crashes.
User Feedback: Provides clear messages to users in case of invalid operations or inputs.
🔹 5. Unit Testing
Test Suite: A comprehensive set of unit tests ensures each component functions as intended.
Continuous Integration: Facilitates ongoing testing to maintain code quality.
🔹 6. Design Patterns
Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Observer Pattern: Establishes a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to listen to and react to events.
